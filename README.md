## RoHAWKtics Scouting Program ##

This is an android application to be used by FIRST Team 3824 for scouting other teams robots during competition in order to come up with the most optimal strategy for any given alliance partners and opponents and for selecting elimination alliance partners.

Version: alpha (pre-numbers)


### How do I get set up? ###
The only two things currently needed to work with this project are a git client ([SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) is recommended if you are unfamiliar with command line) and [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html). With Android Studio code can be tested using either an emulator or an android device connect via usb.

* The repository currently uses two git submodules and I am not perfectly sure that these will clone correctly. If they don't then contact me and we will figure it out. - Andrew

* Also this application will be setup to run on Nexus 7 and Nexus 9 tablets
