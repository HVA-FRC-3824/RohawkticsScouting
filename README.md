### How do I get set up? ###
The only two things currently needed to work with this project are a git client (SourceTree is recommended if you are unfamiliar with command line) and Android Studio. With Android Studio code can be tested using either an emulator or an android device connect via usb.


### What is git? ###

Git is a distributed version control system. Git uses a concept of repositories, branches, and commits to keep track of the history of a collection of files.

### Contribution guidelines ###

At this time, we are planning to use a branch/pull request workflow. There is a nice guide to the flow [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

When implementing a new feature, you should create a branch off of master. Once you have implemented the new feature, you should create a pull request. At this point, the code will enter an informal review process prior to merging into master.

### Who do I talk to? ###

This repository is current managed by Andrew Messing (akmessing1@yahoo.com).
